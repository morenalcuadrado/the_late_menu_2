Hey guys. This is part of a series of practices that I will be uploading so you can see my skills, abilities and knowledge. Also as a guide for those who are just starting out and who knows someone might like what I do.
This time it's an update of the "favourite menu". My goal was to align the images using "span". 

As for the colour I wanted to give it a late 60's mid-paced restaurant menu vibe.
Leave me a comment if you want to know more. Chau.
